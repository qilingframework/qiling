```

```

additional options
```
stack_address = 0xhexaddress
stack_size = 0xhexaddress
interp_base = 0xhexaddress
mmap_start = 0xhexaddress
output = ["debug","off","disasm","dump"] // dump=(disam + debug)
log_console
reg_dir = /dir/path/to/clean_registery // must within rootfs
reg_diff = /file/path/to/registry_dump // must within rootfs
```
